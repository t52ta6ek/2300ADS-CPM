# 2300ADS-CPM
CP/M 2.2 for the GenRad 2300 Advanced Development System (aka MicroKit, FutureData, GenRad and Kontron 2300 ADS)

<b>58kCPMv1.85_work:</b><br>
This folder contains an image of the working directory taken from a backup of my 35mb hard drive. This contains both sources to the CP/M system and various utilties used to create the CP/M image. Also present are vaious utilites used for formatting disks, setting serial parameters and such under 2300 ADS CP/M.

<b>winbuild:</b><br>
This folder contains the various files described above, but pre-packed with the Z80-SIM CP/M emulator. You can download and unpack the .zip file under Windows and perform the build of the entire CP/M 2.2 system for the 2300 ADS.

Should you have any, I can still offer limited assistance with any questions about this machine.
